# DataEngineeringProject02

# Overview
This project demonstrates creating tables in PostgreSQL using Python, specifically leveraging the psycopg2 library. The scriptS (Project 1 & 2) sets up a connection to a PostgreSQL database, creates tables for departments, locations, and employees, inserts data into these tables, and performs a select query to retrieve data.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
psycopg2 library

Install the required library using the following commands:

# Usage
## 1. Database Connection:

Edit the script to provide your PostgreSQL database connection details (host, database, user, password).
Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running.
 
## 2. Run the Script:

Execute the script Data_Engineering_Porject_01.py in a Python environment.

## 3. Review Console Output:

Check the console output for any errors or success messages during the execution of SQL queries.

# .Project Structure

Data_Engineering_Porject_01.py: Main Python script with the data engineering logic.

## Notes
This script assumes that the PostgreSQL server is running locally with default settings. Adjust the connection parameters accordingly.
